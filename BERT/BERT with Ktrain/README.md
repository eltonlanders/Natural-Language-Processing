Apart from the Hugging Face's transformers library, ktrain is another popular library for BERT. <br>
ktrain is a low-code library for augmented machine learning that was developed by Arun S. Maiya. <br>
It is a lightweight wrapper for Keras that makes it easier for us to build, train, and deploy deep learning models. <br>
It also includes several pre-trained models that make tasks such as text classification, summarization, question answering, translation, regression, and more easier. <br>
